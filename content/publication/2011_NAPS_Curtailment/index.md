abstract = "During the past decade, there has been tremendous development in wind energy all over the world. However, due to the power system operational constraints, reliability requirement as well as other technical limitations (e.g. wind prediction errors), significant portions of the wind generation resources (WGR) are curtailed in real-time operations. Among various power system operating constraints, transmission congestion plays a significant role. In this paper, we analyze the problem of the wind curtailment due to transmission congestion. Furthermore, we propose a sensitivity index to assess the impact of transmission line limit on wind generation curtailment. An analytical expression of the sensitivity index is derived based on the network theory of power system. The modified IEEE RTS-24 Bus system is used to verify the proposed theory."
