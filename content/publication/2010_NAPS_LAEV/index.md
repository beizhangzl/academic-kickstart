abstract = "The major subject of this paper is the analysis and simulation of market-based coordination of variable resources with storage systems such as aggregated Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Starting from our recent work on modeling and model predictive scheduling of conventional generation, variable generation, and battery storage systems, we further develop in this paper a look-ahead multi-layered simulation platform which (1) takes into account of the transmission congestion; and (2) co-optimizes individual participants' profits from both energy and regulation services markets. In contrast with today's operation software, the proposed scheduling framework could improve the overall system efficiency while observing the transmission network constraints. We illustrate the improved operational efficiency in a modified IEEE 14-bus system."
