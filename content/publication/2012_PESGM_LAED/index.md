abstract = "We propose a framework of look-ahead dispatch which considers forecast uncertainty and infeasibility management. Two major advantages of the framework are demonstrated: 1) economic performance improvement under the presence of forecast uncertainty; and, 2)feasibility enhancement of the dispatch problem. In the look-ahead dispatch framework, a weighted predictive scheduling (WPS) technique is proposed to relieve the negative impacts on dispatch due to wind forecast uncertainty in future steps. Look-ahead security management (LSM) is introduced, which is a technique to identify and quantify potential infeasibility of the dispatch in advance. The LSM technique is shown to be capable of working out an optimal recovery plan for future violation of system security. Finally, the proposed techniques are illustrated in a modified 24 Bus Reliability Test System."
